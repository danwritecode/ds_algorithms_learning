## Logarithms

Logarithms can be thought of as the inverse of exponents. 

Examples: 

log10 100 = 2
log2 8 = 3
log2 16 = 4
log5 25 = 2

Think about it this way: what number needs to be the exponent of the "base" in order to equal the argument 


## Binary Search

Covered in the code example. 


## Running Time and BigO Notation

#### Running Time

For a simple search of 100 items, it can take 100 guess, this is: *linear time*
For a binary search of 100 items, worst case is 7 cases: this is: *log time* (log2 128 = 7, log2 64 = 6...worst case is 7)

For a simple search of *1,000,000,000* items, it can take 1,000,000,000 guesses, this is: *linear time*
For a binary search of *1,000,000,000* items, worst case is 30 cases: this is: *log time* (log2 1,000,000,000 = 30)
